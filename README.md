## Available Scripts

### First of all, you must use this script in order to connect database. `cd json-server` and then `json-server --host 192.1*.*.* --watch db.json -p 3001 -d 2000 (replace * it with your computers IP address)`
If you want, you can customize npm json-server command in package.json file. Just change example IP address with your computers IP address.

### Start project in your terminal using `yarn start`, `npm start` or `expo start`.

### Install and run expo on your android or ios device to view the app.

### (*) `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React Native in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
